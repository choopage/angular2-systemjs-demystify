`npm install angular2`

Copy and paste the dependencies required from the warning of UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY
`npm install es6-shim@^0.35.0 reflect-metadata@0.1.2 rxjs@5.0.0-beta.2 zone.js@^0.6`

To run this one needs to have tsc installed
`tsc -init`

Modify tsconfig.json that was generated by the previous command

```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es5",
        "noImplicitAny": false,
        "sourceMap": false,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "outDir": "dist"
    },
    "files": [
        "src/main.ts"
    ]
}
```

`npm install systemjs`

Next create the index.html and setup the System config in the index.html

Next is to kick start the typings
`typings init`

`typings install es6-shim --ambient --save`

There are a lot more steps to follow through. It's best to watch the video and follow through it.
